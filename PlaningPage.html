                <h2> Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p> The mission of this website is to provide the view with weather, water, climate data, forecasts, and warnings for the prevention of damages and the protection of life, property and they effective use of time. As well as to help the local economy run smoothly. <i>The audience I intend this website for is the people who live in Franklin, Greenville, and Springfield as well as any people who may be traveling through those areas.?</i></p>
        
                    <p> The site will accomplish this goal by having professional meteorologists look at and analyze weather patterns and then publish that information online in an easily accessible and effective manner. We will also work with other meteorologists to create an accurate big picture so we can report weather to our viewers. And finally we will provide weekly forecasts and announcements of incoming warnings to help our viewers. </p>
