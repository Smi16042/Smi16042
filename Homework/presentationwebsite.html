    <h1> CSS Selectors, Attributes, Descendent and Child</h1>
       
    <h2> Selectors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> A selector allows you to taget specifiic HTML elements that you want to style</li>
        <li> An example of a HTML element being paragraph, main, title</li>
        <li>The selector "selects" the element of the html page. There are 57 (+?) different selectors that can be used in CSS </li>
            
        <li>For example you could select a paragraph or a title and then use CSS to change the color, size, and other characteristics </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3> Attribute</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>The attribute selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute or value.
 </li>
     <li>The Purpose; Style all attribute elements with a target audience</li>
     <li>Basically this allows us to select one thing from our code and change it without having to manually change every single line of the code that it is in.
 </li>
     
     <li> Ex; a[target]{background-color:yellow;}</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h4> Descendent</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>A descendent selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element, the first element represents the ancestor element (like a parent element) the second selector represents the element were trying to match
</li>
        <li>They are written with a space between them.
</li>
        <li>You read it right to left
</li>
        <li> Ex; p(ancestor)  a(match) </li>
        <li> This is useful for when you want to select certain areas without changing the entire code.
</li>
        <li>When writing the descendent you can make it very specific, or less specific and get almost the same result, be as specific as possible 
</li>
        <li>The more efficient and robust you are the  easier it is to transfer and the easier it is to move to a different document</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h5>Child Selector </h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Child selectors are written with two selectors that are separated with a greater than symbol</li>
        <li>Child selectors only select items that are direct children </li>
        <li>White spaces are ignored
</li>
        <li> Read right to left
</li>
        <li> Not supported by IE6
</li>
        <li>Ex;  p>a { }  			OR 				p  >  a { }
 </li>
        <li> This is useful for when you want to affect only specific areas of the code without having your changes cascading further down.
</li>
