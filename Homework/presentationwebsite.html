<h1> CSS Selectors, Attributes, Descendent and Child</h1>       
<h2> Selectors</h2>
<p> A selector allows you to taget specifiic HTML elements that you want to style</p>
<p> An example of a HTML element being paragraph, main, title</p>
<p>The selector "selects" the element of the html page. There are 57 (+?) different selectors that can be used in CSS </p>
<p>For example you could select a paragraph or a title and then use CSS to change the color, size, and other characteristics <p> 
<h3> Attribute</h3>
<p>The attribute selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute or value</p>
<p>The Purpose; Style all attribute elements with a target audience</p>
<p>Basically this allows us to select one thing from our code and change it without having to manually change every single line of the code that it is in.</p>
<p> Ex; a[target]{background-color:yellow;}</p>

<h4> Descendent</h4>
<p>A descendent selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element, the first element represents the ancestor element (like a parent element) the second selector represents the element were trying to match</p>
<p>They are written with a space between them</p>
<p>You read it right to left</p>
<p> Ex; p(ancestor)  a(match) </p>
<p> This is useful for when you want to select certain areas without changing the entire code.</p>
<p>When writing the descendent you can make it very specific, or less specific and get almost the same result, be as specific as possible </p>
<p>The more efficient and robust you are the  easier it is to transfer and the easier it is to move to a different document</p>

<h5>Child Selector </h5>
<p>Child selectors are written with two selectors that are separated with a greater than symbol</p>
<p>Child selectors only select items that are direct children </p>
<p>White spaces are ignored</p>
<p> Read right to left</p>
<p> Not supported by IE6</p>
<p>Ex;  p>a { }  			OR 				p  >  a { }</p>
<p> This is useful for when you want to affect only specific areas of the code without having your changes cascading further down</p>
