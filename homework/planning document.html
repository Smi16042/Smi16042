    <h1>Site Purpose</h1>
    <p> The purpose of this site is to inform current league of legend players about some of the current tactics that works in the game. </p>
    
    <h2> Target Audience</h2>
    <p> The target audience is current League of legends players who have reached the rank of silver and gold, this encompases roughly 65% of the playerbase. Because the game is so popular and has so many fans defineing the audience is hard however most players are generally between the age of 15-25 and male. Keeping this in mind I will keep my comments short and full of data.</p>
    
    <h3> Example Persona</h3>
